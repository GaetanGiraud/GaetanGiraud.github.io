# What the heck is this about?

I am a software enthusiast, interested in how technologies work and how they can make a concrete difference in the world, versed in 
 the hard (algorithms, AI, programming, etc.. ) as well as in the soft side of software. 

This combined interest comes from my experience of sucesses and failures in all sort of software endeavours, from the smallest to the biggest, 
where the combination technology/people was not properly taken into account. 

Because at the end of the day, Software is made by and for human, and either in its development process (how software is made) as in how it is used 
to serve use people (unless [Elon Musk's got it right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOiNrt2zJoY) ).

On this site you'll find some introductions, tutorials and explanations on topics ranging from java, Software Architecture all the way to Deep Learning.

I will use this site to organize my thoughts, and hopefully pass around a bit of wisdom.

Cheers,
