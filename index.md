# Content

This an overview of the different topics that I have or am planning to handle on this site. 
This is being really nothing more than a blog, the topics that I will publish might not be all relevant to each other.
 
My goal is to explain what I think are (relatively) complex topics in as straightforward as possible manner.

All the code will be made available on my [github account](https://github.com/GaetanGiraud/).
